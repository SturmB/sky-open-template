# sky-open-template

Adobe Illustrator extension to quickly find and open files from a user-chosen location. At Sky Unlimited, Inc., it is used for opening printing templates for products, thus the name "sky-open-template."

## Installation

Install the latest .ZXP release with [Anastasiy's Extension Manager][aem].

## Usage

1. Launch **Open Template** from Illustrator's **Window**/**Extensions** menu.
2. Click the "Templates" button and choose a folder from which you frequently open Illustrator files.
3. After a few seconds (depending on how many files/folders the panel must scan), the main file list will be populated with all of the `.ai` files it could find.
4. Pick one or more files from the list and click the "Open" button.

Once the file list has been populated, you may used the "Filter" search box to narrow the list down to files containing only the characters you type.

_Note: The filter box is simple and does not accept any advanced syntaxes such as regular expressions at this time._
